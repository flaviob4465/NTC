                <p> CrossFit is a fitness regimen developed by Greg Glassman over several decades. CrossFit is constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity. All CrossFit workouts are based on functional movements, and these movements reflect the best aspects of gymnastics, weightlifting, running, rowing and more. These are the core movements of life. They move the largest loads the longest distances, so they are ideal for maximizing the amount of work done in the shortest time. Intensity is essential for results and is measurable as work divided by timeÑor power. The more work you do in less time, or the higher the power output, the more intense the effort. By employing a constantly varied approach to training, functional movements and intensity lead to dramatic gains in fitness.</p>
                <p>The community that spontaneously arises when people do these workouts together is a key component of why CrossFit is so effective, and it gave birth to a global network of CrossFit affiliates that number over 13,000. Harnessing the natural camaraderie, competition and fun of sport or game yields an intensity that cannot be matched by other means.</p>
                <p>While CrossFit challenges the world's fittest, the program is designed for universal scalability, making it the perfect application for any committed individual, regardless of experience. We scale load and intensity; we donÕt change the program. The needs of Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>There are more than 13,000 licensed CrossFit affiliates worldwide, and the number is growing. Run independently by credentialed CrossFit trainers, these affiliates provide coaches who can teach you the movements and help you acclimate to the program. They'll provide you with programming, technical expertise, equipment, motivation and everything you need to get all the benefits of the CrossFit program.</p>
                <p>The only Affiliated Box in your zone is <a href="https://www.crossfitaveiro.com" target="_blank">CrossFit Aveiro!</a></p>
                <h3>CrossFit.com</h3>
                <p> <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/workout;" target="_blank">CrossFit.com</a> publishes the workout of the dayÑWODÑdaily, and athletes can reference the Exercises and Demos page to learn the movements commonly seen in the workouts.</p>
                <p>It must be understood that CrossFit.com workouts are extremely demanding and will tax the capacities of even the world's best athletes. You would be well advised to take on the WOD cautiously and move toward completing the workouts comfortably and consistently before throwing yourself at them 100 percent. The best results have come for those who have scaled the workouts down to establish competency before maximizing intensity. Workouts can be scaledÑor modifiedÑby adjusting the length, number of reps, loads, distances or even movements. Properly implemented scaling preserves the intent of the original workout while taking into account the unique needs of the athlete.</p>
                <p>The workouts on CrossFit.com represent one presentation of the CrossFit philosophy of constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity. You'll see a mixture of gymnastics, strength training and conditioning, all presented in variety of formats. Some workouts are longer than others, and some will contain more or less elements. The overall goal is to ensure athletes are exposed to a broad array of movements, loads and time domains.</p>

                <h3>The Games are a Three Stage Journey</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The Games season is broken up into three stages. The first stage is the Open. This five-week, five-workout competition is held in CrossFit affiliates and garage gyms around the world. Workouts are released online each Thursday, and athletes have until the following Monday to submit their scores. Anyone who's at least 14 years old can sign up, and join in the first stage of the CrossFit Games season.</p>
                <p>It must be understood that CrossFit.com workouts are extremely demanding and will tax the capacities of even the world's best athletes. You would be well advised to take on the WOD cautiously and move toward completing the workouts comfortably and consistently before throwing yourself at them 100 percent. The best results have come for those who have scaled the workouts down to establish competency before maximizing intensity. Workouts can be scaledÑor modifiedÑby adjusting the length, number of reps, loads, distances or even movements. Properly implemented scaling preserves the intent of the original workout while taking into account the unique needs of the athlete.</p>
                <p>The top athletes from each of the 18 worldwide regions qualify for the second stage of the competition Ñ Regionals. The Regionals are live, three-day competitions that are held May through June. Top athletes from two regions combine and compete at one of nine Regionals to earn qualifying spots for the CrossFit Games.The number of spots to the Games is 40 men, 40 women and 40 teams. The North American, European and Australasian Regionals each send their top 5 from each division. The Meridian Regional sends four and Latin America will send one from each division.</p>
                <p>The season culminates in the Reebok CrossFit Games. At this point in the season, the field has been whittled down from hundreds of thousands of athletes in the Open to the world's fittest 40 men, 40 women, 40 teams, 80 teenagers, and 240 masters. The CrossFit Games rank the world's fittest, and determine who is the Fittest on Earth.</p>

                <p>Annie Thorisdottir Ñ or Iceland Annie, as sheÕs sometimes calledÑis a two-time CrossFit Games champion (2011-2012) and seven-time CrossFit Games veteran.</p>
                <p>Of those appearances, sheÕs stood on the podium four timesÑshe took second in 2010 and 2014 in addition to her title-winning finishesÑand with the exception of 2015, when she was forced to withdraw due to heat stroke, sheÕs never finished below the top 13. </p>
                <p>First recognized at the 2009 CrossFit Games, when she famously performed her first muscle-up mid-competition, Thorisdottir often competes with a smile and has been celebrated throughout her career for her positive attitude, which permeated even her season on the sidelines, when a back injury in 2013 forced her to sit out.</p>
                <p>A former gymnast, Thorisdottir owns <a href="">CrossFit Reykjavik</a> in Iceland.</p>
