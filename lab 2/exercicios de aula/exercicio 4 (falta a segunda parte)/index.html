        <p>Ryden created this work for the American Ballet Theatre's production of Whipped Cream, an adaptation of a 1924 Richard Strauss ballet about a boy who eats too much candy and, in the delirium of a world-class sugar high, dreams that his dessert has come to life.
            Ryden designed props, costumes, and backdrops for the production, combining sugary pinks and pastels with a darker palette of grays and neutrals. The result: a candy land that threatens to become sickeningly sweet.

            <p>"The Nutcracker" may be the ballet with the best-known world of candy, but American Ballet Theatre is upping the delicious factor with its new dessert-themed ballet "Whipped Cream."
                A two-act ballet titled Whipped Cream premiered at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa, California, on March 2017, for which Ryden developed costumes and sets. The ballet was created by world-renowned choreographer Alexei Ratmansky for the American Ballet Theatre.
                It is a story about a young boy who overindulges at a Vienna pastry shop and falls into a surreal delirium. With libretto and music by Richard Strauss, the ballet, originally titled Schlagobers, was first performed by the Vienna State Opera in 1924.
                “It just seemed like an exciting adventure,” Ryden says of why he was drawn to the project. “And it hit at the right time for me. I'd just finished a series of art shows, and this seemed like something different. Just bringing the other dimensions beyond a static painting — story, action, movement, music, all those things.”
                The result is an explosion of fantasy, surrealism and traditional ballet — “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” meets “Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children” meets “The Nutcracker.”</p>

        <p>Blending themes of pop culture with techniques reminiscent of the old masters, Mark Ryden has created a singular style that blurs the traditional boundaries between high and low art.</p>
        <p>His work first garnered attention in the 1990s when he ushered in a new genre of painting, "Pop Surrealism", dragging a host of followers in his wake.</p>
        <p>Ryden has trumped the initial surrealist strategies by choosing subject matter loaded with cultural connotation. Ryden's vocabulary ranges from cryptic to cute, treading a fine line between nostalgic cliché and disturbing archetype</p>
        <p>Seduced by his infinitely detailed and meticulously glazed surfaces, the viewer is confronted with the juxtaposition of the childhood innocence and the mysterious recesses of the soul. A subtle disquiet inhabits his paintings; the work is achingly beautiful as it hints at darker psychic stuff beneath the surface of cultural kitsch.</p>
